So you’re interested in a Marketing career are ya? Think you have the skills of a creative ninja as well as the ability to be an analytics virtuoso? Well we might have an opportunity that would put those super hero skills to the test. We are looking for the type of marketer that is more excited to post a targeted ad on social media than a pic of what you just ate for lunch. We want someone to join our team who rarely hits the ‘Skip Ad’ button on Youtube because you like to analyze messaging strategies. We need the type of marketer that is ready to hit the road running and be willing to learn from some pretty smart humans we have around here.

This Marketing specialist role will work directly with one of our elite Sr. Marketing Managers in developing and executing mind-blowing marketing strategies that will cause our competitors to lose sleep at night.

Whether you have culinary skills or not, if you feel that you fit this description and you match the requirements below, let’s talk.
Some of the Things We’re Gonna Have You Do
Be a data storyteller. You are not expected to just pull the analytics for regular monthly reports. You will be expected to provide insights and help others understand the story the data is telling us.

Preferred that you have a Bachelor’s degree in marketing, business, or communications or equivalent experience (whatever that means)
Spock-like analytic skills (sans the death grip) – you should be no stranger to Google Analytics
Managed email campaigns - email is still a key channel for us and we need someone who loves to tackle KPIs like open rate, click rate and maximize ROI through this channel
Experience in managing and optimizing PPC campaigns
Have experience in the creative development process - This is not an errand boy/girl position. We want someone that will bring to the table innovative thinking and out-of-the box ideas
Strong project management and multitasking skills are a must (we know, we’ve read all the articles about how multitaskers get less done; what we mean is that we’ve got lots to do and need someone who is good at doing lots. Capeesh?)
Experience with survey tools
Assist the team in promoting and executing our multiple events
And probably most important, you must be a good human – Basically, we are looking for someone who treats others with respect, is a good listener, likes to laugh and has the humility to learn",18-05-2021,marketing,"SLC, Utah",fulltime,19 05 2021
